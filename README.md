# outdated

This Application is meant to make it easier to know what Project has outdated Packages, Outdated Packages are Packages that have gone out of Long Term Support (short lts). There is a colour-code to what state a Project is in:

Green: Project is up to date

Yellow: One or more Packages released a new lts version, you "should" migrate to it now since the other version is still in support

Red: One or more Packages are outdated

Black: All Packages are outdated, this is not good
